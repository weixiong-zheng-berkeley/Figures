\begin{frame}{Unit testing and documentation}
	\begin{block}{We document and test everything possible}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We rewrote \ttt{BART} twice:
			\begin{itemize}
					\item First time, we restructured \ttt{BART} and documented everything with \ttt{doxygen}.
					\item Second time, we added unit testing.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Philosophy: everything be documented and every function/class be tested if possible.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Documentation leads to better understandability of code in the future development.
				\item Unit testing ensures new codes do not affect correctness of existing code.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{G(oogle)Test and CTest are both used}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We want unit testing to be efficient and compatible with MPI
			\begin{itemize}
				\item GTest is super efficient but hard to obtain compatibility with MPI.
				\item CTest is slow but compatible with MPI.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Not all the testings require MPI
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We use GTest for all serial testing
				\item We leave all MPI related testings to CTest.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
