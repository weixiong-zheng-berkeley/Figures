\begin{frame}{Meshing capability in \ttnc{BART}}
	\begin{block}{BART was initially implemented for homogenized mesh}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hyper-rectangle meshing based on \ttt{deal.II}:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lines in 1D, rectangles in 2D and regular cuboid in 3D
				\item Material ID assigned to coarsest mesh and stored in cell objects tractable when refining
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Pin-resolved meshing}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Recent development enables the use of pin-resolved mesh
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Rectangular (prism) pin is supported; hexagonal (prism) pin is under development
				\item {\bf Goodness:} meshing does {\bf NOT} depend on \ttt{Cubit} or \ttt{gmsh}. \ttt{BART} realizes wrapper functions based on \ttt{deal.II} to draw complex geometries.
			\end{itemize}
			\item We compose different pin models and replicate based on pin types in 2D.
			\item 3D meshes is realized by extruding 2D mesh.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Meshing in Parallel}
	\begin{block}{Distributed triangulation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Triangulation (meshing) needs to support parallelism for parallel computations.
			\item \ttt{deal.II} supports two ways of triangulation in parallel
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Shared (\ttt{ParMETIS} based): every processor has a copy of the global triangulation.
				\item Distributed (\ttt{p4est} based): every processor only knows cells living on itself and a layer of neighboring cells from other processors on the local triangulation boundary
			\end{itemize}
			\item \ttt{BART} supports distributed meshing from \ttt{deal.II}.
			\item 1D meshing is serial as \ttt{deal.II} has no parallel support
		\end{itemize}
